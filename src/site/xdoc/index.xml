    <section name="Advanced Search Taxonomy Workflow Plugin">
      <div><p>Advanced Search Taxonomy Workflow plugin provides the cms users an ability to simultaneously set 
      multiple documents with selected taxonomy categories using the Advanced Search perspective.</p>
        <p>Assume that you already enabled taxonomy to one or more document types, and you have created a taxonomy.
        Using advanced search, you can filter those documents you want to change, and set them altogether with your selected taxonomy categories.
        </p>
        <p>The CMS administrator can configure the taxonomy name to populate categories.</p>
