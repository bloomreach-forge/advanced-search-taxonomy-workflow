# Advanced Search Taxonomy Workflow Plugin

The Advanced Search Taxonomy Workflow plugin provides CMS users an ability to simultaneously set multiple documents with 
selected taxonomy categories using the Advanced Search perspective.

Assuming that taxonomy is enabled to one or more document types, you can filter those documents you want to change, and 
set them altogether with your selected taxonomy categories.

The CMS administrator can configure the taxonomy name to populate categories.
